## Sketch 4 - Vectors 

### Due March 28th

1. Take one of your previous exercises (or build a new sketch) and add vectors to it to creation motion. You could do this by taking a graphic from a previous sketch or you could make a new one. Make it into a class. That class should have vectors for loction, velocity, and acceleration. That class should also have methods that display the graphic, another method to update the variables, and possibly another to check if it's off screen. 

Your update method should only deal with updating your variables for acceleration, velocity and location. You should be doing some vector math in there - adding vectors, subtracting vectors, multiplication, limit, etc.

2. Then make the graphics move


Bonus:

- create multiple objects with different velocities and accelerations. Store them in an array.

- Have these objects move towards different goals: the mouse, a particular graphic/monster, etc.
